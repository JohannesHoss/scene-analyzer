EXT. VIENNA, JUNE - DAY
Early morning. A view over Viennese rooftops, almost all of
the houses are built in the 19th century in Gründerzeit style
and have - where the old roof used to be - a contrasting
modern penthouse, huge terraces, glass windows. Cranes are
spread over the city in front of the backdrop of wooded hills
surrounding the city.
Thick clouds are covering the sky. The wind picks up.

EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY
The apartment building, a Gründerzeit-house, where this story
is set, is covered in scaffolding.
The debris net flutters in the wind.
Sand and little stones on the wooden planks are blown away.
The scaffolding creaks in its metal joints, rattled by wind
gusts. A piece of debris net breaks free and flies away in
the wind.

And then it starts to rain.

INT. EVA'S BEDROOM - DAY
The sound of rain drumming outside on the metal windowsill.
A drop starts to form on the ceiling, grows bigger, heavier,
until gravity pulls it down. It lands on the cheek of EVA,
41, who stirs. When a second drop lands on her face, she
wakes up, immediately looking up at the ceiling.

INT. ELIAS' ROOM - DAY
Trying hard to make no sound, Eva enters the room. It's a
child's room and the child in question, ELIAS, 5, is fast
asleep in his bed.

INT. EVA'S BEDROOM - DAY
Eva carries a big pot into her bedroom and places it next to
her bed under the dripping spot together with an old towel.

MONTAGE SEQUENCE - DAY
Clothes are being thrown into the washing machine, door shut,
beep, the water enters the washing machine.

INT. EVA'S HALLWAY - DAY
Eva, dressed, her toothbrush in her mouth, Elias' toothbrush
in her hand, hurries behind Elias.

INT. STAIRCASE BACK HOUSE; EVA'S FLOOR - DAY
Eva opens her door, searching for the source of the sound.
The staircase is covered in dust.
